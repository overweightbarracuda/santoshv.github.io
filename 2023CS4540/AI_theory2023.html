<p>
What is the basis of intelligence? How can neural networks, artificial or natural, provably lead to perception, learning and cognition? We'll begin by studying a few classics, highlight the gaps and challenges posed by modern artificial models and the brain, and then discuss more recent rigorous proposals. 

<p><b>Prerequisites</b>: algorithms, linear algebra.</p><br>


<p><b>Grading</b>:<br>
HW: 4-6 Problem sets.<br>
Exams: Two in-class exams. No final. <br>
Project: Each team can choose one of the following options: (a) read a paper and provide an insightful explanation/simpler proof/ generalization (b) prove a conjecture (c) formulate a precise conjecture supported by experimental or theoretical evidence. A list of candidate projects will be provided.<br>
