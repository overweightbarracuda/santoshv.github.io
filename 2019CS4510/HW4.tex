\problem{1. Single Start}{2}
 Suppose that $P$ is a PFA that instead of having a start state, has a probability
 distribution over which state it will start in. Construct a new PFA $P'$ that has a
 single start state and outputs the same strings with the same probabilities as $P$.

\problem{2. Steady State}{2}
Consider the PFA with 4 states $A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2$. There are transitions $(A_i, B_j)$
and $(B_j, A_i)$ for each pair $(i,j)$. Show that this PFA does not reach a steady state
distribution from some starting distributions/states. Now add the transition $(A_i, A_i)$
with positive probability. Show that it will now reach a steady state from any starting
distribution.

\problem{3. Applications}{2}
Investigate one real-world application of PFAs (Hidden Markov Models) and report back on
their history, success and status (1 page limit).
