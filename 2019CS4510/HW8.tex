\problem{1. Dominating Set}{2}
Prove that the {\em Dominating Set} problem is NP-complete.\\
A subset of vertices $S$ of of an undirected graph $G$ is called a dominating set if every other vertex in $G$ is
adjacent to some vertex in the subset $S$.\\
$Dominating~Set = \{\langle G,k\rangle: G \text{ has a dominating set with at most $k$
vertices}\}$

\problem{2. Cuts}{2}
A cut is a partition of vertices of a graph into two disjoint subsets, and the size of a
cut is defined as the number of edges crossing the cut.\\
Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ and an integer $k$, decide whether there exists a cut of size at
most $k$. Show that the language for this decision problem is in NP and co-NP. Explain your answer.

\problem{3. Bow Ties are Cool}{2}
A bowtie is a graph on an even number of vertices, say $2k$, in which there are two disjoint
cliques of size $k$ with exactly one edge between the 2 cliques.\\

BOWTIE Problem\\
\textit{Input}: An undirected graph $G=(V,E)$ and an integer goal $k$.\\
\textit{Output}: YES if there exists a bowtie of size $2k$ as an induced subgraph of $G$ , i.e., there are disjoint subsets $S$ and $T$ of $V$ which are both cliques of size $k$ and have exactly one edge between them,\\
or NO, if no bowtie of $2k$ vertices exists in $G$.\\
Prove that BOWTIE is NP-complete.
