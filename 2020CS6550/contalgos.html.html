<h2>Continuous Algorithms: Optimization and Sampling</h2>
<h3>Santosh Vempala</h3>
<h4>Spring 2020. TR: 9:30-10:45</h4>
<p>The design of algorithms is traditionally a discrete endeavor. However, many advances have come from a 
continuous viewpoint. Typically, a continuous process, deterministic or randomized is designed (or shown) to have 
desirable properties, such as approaching an optimal solution or a desired distribution, and an algorithm is 
derived from this by appropriate discretization. We will use this viewpoint to develop several general techniques and build up to the state-of-the-art in polynomial algorithms for optimization and sampling.
