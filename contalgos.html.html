<h2>Continuous Algorithms</h2>
<h3>Santosh Vempala</h3>
<h4>Spring 2019. MW 9:30-10:45am.</h4>
<p>The design of algorithms is traditionally a discrete endeavor. However, many advances have come from a 
continuous viewpoint. Typically, a continuous process, deterministic or randomized is designed (or shown) to have 
desirable properties, such as approaching an optimal solution or a desired distribution, and an algorithm is 
derived from this by appropriate discretization. In interesting and general settings, the current fastest 
methods are a consequence of this perspective. We will discuss several examples of algorithms for
high-dimensional optimization and sampling, and use them to understand the following concepts in detail.

<li>Reduction</li>
<li>Elimination</li>
<li>Conditioning</li>
<li>Geometrization</li>
<li>Expansion</li>
<li>Sparsification</li>
<li>Acceleration</li>
<li>Decomposition</li>
<li>Discretization</li>

<b>Format</b>: This course is a research seminar. I will give most of the lectures and class participants will give the
rest.<br> 
A student taking the class for credit is expected to (possibly partnering with another student): <br>
(a) Scribe one lecture <br>
(b) Present in class <br>
(c) Study in more depth the topic of (a) or (b) and prepare an expository note and/or work on a related open problem.<br>
