<h1>Continuous Algorithms</h1>
<h3>Santosh Vempala</h3>
<h3>Spring 2019. Tu-Th, 9:30-10:45am.</h3>
<p>While the design of algorithms is traditionally a discrete endeavor, in recent years advances have come from a 
continuous viewpoint. Typically, a continuous process, deterministic or randomized is designed (or shown) to have 
desirable properties, such as approaching an optimal solution or a desired distribution, and an algorithm is 
derived from this by appropriate discretization. We will discuss examples of this for optimization 
(gradient descent, interior point methods) and sampling (Brownian motion, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo). 
In interesting and general settings, the current fastest methods are a consequence of this perspective.</p>

<b>Topics</b> (tentative):<br>
<ol>
<li> Ordinary Differential Equations</li>
<li> Optimization by gradient descent</li>
<li> Stochastic Differential Equations </li>
<li> Sampling by Diffusion </li>
<li> Optimization by stochastic gradient descent </li>
<li> The interface of continuous and discrete: lattices, diophantine approximation, integer programming.</li>
</ol>

<b>Format</b>: This course is a research seminar. I will give over half the lectures and class participants will give the
rest.<br> 
A student taking the class for credit is expected to <br>
(a) Scribe one lecture <br>
(b) Present one lecture, possibly collaborating with another student <br>
(c) Study in more depth the topic of (a) or (b) and prepare an expository note and/or work on a related open problem.<br>
