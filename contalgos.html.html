<h1>Continuous Algorithms</h1>
<h3>Santosh Vempala</h3>
<h3>Spring 2019. Tu-Th, 9:30-10:45am.</h3>
<p>The design of algorithms is traditionally a discrete endeavor. However, many advances have come from a 
continuous viewpoint. Typically, a continuous process, deterministic or randomized is designed (or shown) to have 
desirable properties, such as approaching an optimal solution or a desired distribution, and an algorithm is 
derived from this by appropriate discretization. In interesting and general settings, the current fastest 
methods are a consequence of this perspective. We will discuss several examples in the context of 
high-dimensional optimization and sampling.

<b>Topics</b> (tentative):<br>
<ol>
<li> Geometry I. Ellipsoid; Center-of-Gravity; Simulated Annealing (math: Distribution of mass)</li>
<li> Homotopy (path following) I. Gradient Descent (math: Ordinary Differential Equations; fixed point theorem)</li>
<li> Homotopy II. Stochastic Gradient Descent, Sampling by Diffusion (math: Stochastic Differential Equations; isoperimetry)</li>
<li> Geometry II. Newton method; Interior Point; Hit-and-run/Dikin walk (math: local, non-Euclidean geometry)</li> 
<li> Geometry III. Central path; Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (math: basics of Riemannian manifolds)</li>
<li> Duality/Reductions. </li>
<li> Contraction. Iterative methods; "Conjugate" (math: Taylor expansion; polynomial approximation)</li> 
<li> Continuous vs discrete. Lattices, diophantine approximation, integer programming (math: geometry of numbers).</li>
</ol>

<b>Format</b>: This course is a research seminar. I will give over half the lectures and class participants will give the
rest.<br> 
A student taking the class for credit is expected to (possibly partnering with another student): <br>
(a) Scribe one lecture <br>
(b) Present one lecture, possibly collaborating with another student <br>
(c) Study in more depth the topic of (a) or (b) and prepare an expository note and/or work on a related open problem.<br>
