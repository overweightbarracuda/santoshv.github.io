<h1>Spring 2019: Continuous Algorithms</h1>
<p>While algorithms and their design is traditionally a discrete endeavor, in recent years advances have come from a continuous viewpoint. Typically, a continuous process, deterministic or randomized is designed or shown to have desirable properties, such as approaching an optimal solution or a desired distribution, and an algorithm is derived from this by appropriate discretization. We will discuss examples of this for optimization (gradient descent, interior point methods) and sampling (Brownian motion, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo). In interesting and general settings, the current fastest methods are derived via this perspective.</p>
